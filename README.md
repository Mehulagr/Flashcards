# Mobile Flashcards
This is a project I worked on for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This part specifically focusses on React Native.

## Platform
This app has been tested in android platform.

## Installing
To get started developing right away:

* clone project using `https://github.com/Mehulagr/Flashcards.git`
* install all project dependencies with `expo start`

'npm start' and 'yarn start' might not work correctly. I used 'expo start' while working.

## Cloned
Starter template was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
